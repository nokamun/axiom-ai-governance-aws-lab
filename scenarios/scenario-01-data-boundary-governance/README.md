# Scenario 1 – Data Boundary Governance
Data Governance | Least Privilege | Monitoring Controls

## Objective
Demonstrate how governance controls restrict an AI assistant to approved knowledge sources while preventing access to sensitive internal data.

## Scenario
An AI research assistant retrieves documents from a knowledge repository. Without proper access controls, the assistant could retrieve sensitive internal information. This scenario implements governance controls to enforce data access boundaries.

## Architecture
User Query → AI Assistant Function → Knowledge Repository → Monitoring Logs

## Controls Implemented
• Least privilege access  
• Data classification boundaries  
• Monitoring and audit visibility  

## Validation
Two test cases validate the controls:

• Approved research query returns a document  
• Sensitive query is denied and logged
