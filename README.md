# AXIOM AI Governance AWS Lab

**AI Governance | Security Architecture | Data Protection | Cloud Security**

This repository explores how modern systems can safely integrate AI assistants without exposing sensitive data. The labs demonstrate governance-first security architecture using principles such as least privilege, data boundaries, and monitoring controls to protect organizational information.

Each lab simulates real-world scenarios where AI capabilities must operate within defined security and governance boundaries.

## The Learning Arc

Each scenario closes a gap the previous one left open:

```
Scenario 01 — Keep bad data out
              S3 ingestion boundaries + IAM tag-based access control

Scenario 02 — Filter bad queries and responses in real time
              Runtime guardrails + PII redaction + anomaly detection

Scenario 03 — Defend against deliberate attacks on the AI itself
              Prompt injection defense + data poisoning prevention
              Based on OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models

Scenario 04 — Lock down identity and access completely
              Zero trust architecture for AI assistant interactions

Scenario 05 — Detect and investigate what slips through
              Full audit trail correlation and threat detection

Scenario 06 — Govern the data lake feeding everything
              Classification, access control, and lineage at scale
```

## Research Focus

- **Data access boundaries** — Restricting AI assistants to approved knowledge sources using identity controls and ingestion boundaries
- **Governance controls for automated systems** — Enforcing least privilege on AI model execution roles and service identities
- **Monitoring and audit visibility** — Capturing allow and deny events across CloudTrail and CloudWatch for full audit trails
- **Security risks introduced by autonomous workflows** — Understanding how AI systems interact with cloud services and where governance gaps emerge
- **OWASP LLM attack defense** — Protecting AI models from prompt injection, data poisoning, and adversarial inputs

## Architecture Principles

Each scenario is built around three core principles:

```
Prevention    → Boundaries enforced before access is attempted
Detection     → All activity logged and auditable
Defense Depth → Multiple independent controls covering the same boundary
```
